mistakes O
they O
had O
made O
and O
accepted O
broad O
responsibility O
for O
the O
actions O
of O
their O

. O

But O
none O
named O
those O
guilty O
of O
ordering O
or O
carrying O
out O
any O
of O
the O
gross O
violations O
of O
human O
rights O
which O
Tutu O
is O
investigating O
. O

But O
Currin O
, O
who O
is O
advising O
several O
people O
regarded O
as O
perpetrators O
, O
said O
this O
was O
not O
the O
best O
way O
to O
achieve O
the O
commission O
's O
aims O
. O

At O
the O
moment O
this O
is O
not O
the O
case O
. O

He O
cited O
Coetzee O
, O
who O
was O
charged O
with O
murder O
after O
confessing O
in O
media O
interviews O
to O
dirty O
tricks O
. O

His O
trial O
is O
due O
to O
start O
in O
December O
but O
the O
truth O
commission O
intends O
to O
decide O
on O
his O
amnesty O
application O
before O
that O
. O

Currin O
said O
the O
law O
had O
to O
be O
changed O
so O
all O
judicial O
prosecutions O
were O
automatically O
suspended O
for O
those O
who O
approached O
the O
truth O
commission O
. O

This O
whole O
thing O
is O
utterly O
useless O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
help O
us O
at O
all O
. O

Political O
scientist O
Jannie B-PER
Gagiano I-PER
said O
he O
doubted O
that O
the O
National O
Party O
, O
which O
implemented O
apartheid O
in O
1948 O
and O
began O
dismantling O
it O
in O
1990 O
, O
felt O
it O
carried O
a O
burden O
of O
guilt O
and O
needed O
to O
be O
exculpated O
through O
the O
commission O
. O

Therefore O
I O
have O
some O
doubts O
about O
achieving O
some O
form O
of O
reconciliation O
. O

One O
has O
to O
feel O
a O
bit O
guilty O
to O
feel O
the O
need O
for O
reconciling O
yourself O
to O
a O
historical O
adversary O

: O
Happily O
the O
strong O
improvement O
in O

is O
not O
an O

But O
Gilbertson O

the O

From O

the O

our O

Dutroux O
. O

Dutroux O
was O
charged O
a O
week O
ago O
after O
police O
rescued O
two O
young O
girls O
from O
a O
concrete O
dungeon O
in O
the O
basement O
of O
one O
of O
the O
six O
houses O
he O
owns O
in O
and O
around O
Charleroi B-LOC
. O

Just O
a O
day O
later O
the O
national O
euphoria O
at O
the O
rescue O
turned O
to O
disgust O
as O
Dutroux O
led O
police O
to O
the O
bodies O
of O
two O
eight-year-old O
girls O
in O
another O
of O
his O
houses O
. O

Julie B-PER
Lejeune I-PER
and O
Melissa B-PER
Russo I-PER
, O
had O
been O
kidnapped O
in O
June O
last O
year O
. O

Dutroux O
said O
they O
starved O
to O
death O
nine O
months O
later O
. O

He O
also O
admitted O
kidnapping O
two O
other O
girls O
, O
An B-PER
Marchal I-PER
and O
Eefje B-PER
Lambrecks I-PER
, O
a O
year O
ago O
. O

The O
fate O
of O
the O
girls O
is O
unknown O
, O
but O
there O
has O
been O
speculation O
they O
were O
sold O
into O
prostitution O
in O
Slovakia O
or O
the O
Czech B-LOC
Republic I-LOC
where O
Dutroux O
was O
a O
frequent O
visitor O
. O

Belgian B-MISC
police O
have O
visited O
Bratislava O
and O
will O
visit O
Prague O
. O

Five O
other O
people O
have O
been O
arrested O
including O
Dutroux O
's O
second O
wife O
Michelle B-PER
Martin I-PER
, O
charged O
as O
an O
accomplice O
. O

The O
others O
have O
been O
charged O
with O
abduction O
and O
illegal O
imprisonment O
of O
children O
or O
are O
suspected O
of O
criminal O
association O
. O

Dutch O
police B-MISC
are O
also O
holding O
a O
74-year O
old O
Dutchman O
in O
connection O
with O
the O
disappearance O
of O
An O
and O
Eefje O
, O
although O
a O
spokesman O
said O
no O
direct O
link O
had O
yet O
been O
established O
. O

At O
least O
part O
of O
the O
speculation O
in O
the O
Belgian B-MISC
media O
of O
high-level O
protection O
for O
Dutroux O
and O
his O
accomplices O
is O
based O
on O
leaked O
documents O
cataloguing O
a O
high O
degree O
of O
police O
bungling O
, O
incompetence O
and O
indifference O
. O

Among O
the O
revelations O
are O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
gendarmerie O
was O
running O
a O
surveillance O
operation O
codenamed O
Othello O
against O
Dutroux O
in O
1995 O
-- O
when O
both O
Julie O
and O
Melissa O
and O
An O
and O
Eefje O
were O
kidnapped O
. O

They O
show O
that O
the O
gendarmes O
were O
aware O
that O
Dutroux O
was O
building O
cells O
in O
some O
of O
his O
houses O
for O
holding O
children O
, O
yet O
this O
information O
was O
either O
not O
passed O
on O
to O
other O
police O
forces O
searching O
for O
the O
missing O
girls O
or O
was O
overlooked O
when O
it O
was O
. O

They O
also O
show O
that O
police O
investigating O
a O
theft O
visited O
Dutroux O
late O
last O
year O
at O
the O
house O
where O
Julie O
and O
Melissa O
were O
being O
held O
but O
accepted O
his O
word O
that O
the O
children O
's O
cries O
they O
could O
hear O
came O
from O
neighbours O
. O

Justice O
Minister O
Stefaan B-PER
De I-PER
Clerck I-PER
has O
admitted O
that O
mistakes O
were O
made O
and O
ordered O
an O
inquiry O
at O
the O
same O
time O
as O
stressing O
there O
were O
no O
indications O
of O
a O
cover-up O
. O

There O
is O
also O
widespread O
disbelief O
that O
no O
one O
appeared O
to O
question O
how O
Dutroux O
, O
an O
unemployed O
father O
of O
three O
with O
no O
visible O
means O
of O
support O
, O
managed O
